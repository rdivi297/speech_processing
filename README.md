### Summary of the Paper:
The paper presents a dataset created to train speech recognition models using a vocabulary of 20 simple words. Designed for applications in voice-controlled devices, it helps evaluate model's ability to recognize commands and differentiate them from similar-sounding non-trigger words, providing a lightweight yet effective resource for speech-based AI research.
